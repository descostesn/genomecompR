Description: 
    genomecompR creates genomic compartments using ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data as follows:
    1) Active promoter: K27ac in TSS-/+1Kb.
    2) Transcription initiation: TSS-1/+1kb overlapping with Ser5P peaks.
    3) Transcription elongation: TSS+1kb to TES overlapping Ser2P.
    4) Transcription termination: TES+50bp
    5) Bivalent promoters: H3K4me3/H3K27me3 overlap TSS-/+1Kb. 
    6) Active enhancer: H3K27ac/H3K4me1/ATAC-seq. They should not overlap with the combination of UCSC refGene, NCBI RefSeq, and GENCODE VM25.
    7) Poised enhancer: H3K27me3/H3K4me1/PRC2. They should not overlap with the combination of UCSC refGene, NCBI RefSeq, and GENCODE VM25.
    8) Polycomb domain: Suz12 and RING1B overlap.
    9) Heterochromatin: H3K9me3
    10) SINE: Overlap with SINE annotations of repeat maskers.
    11) LINE: Overlap with LINE annotations of repeat maskers.
    12) LTR: Overlap with LTR annotations of repeat maskers.
    genomecompR also provides several plotting functions.
